## tweego-bin

An unofficial NPM wrapper for the [Tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) compiler by [@tmedwards](https://github.com/tmedwards/tweego).

Similar to <https://github.com/mattrossman/tweego-node>, but requires no dependencies or NodeJS wrappers.

On installation, downloads the releaseÂ ZIP for your system, and extracts it to `bin/`. NPM will create symlinks `bin/tweego` and `bin/storyformats` inside the folder located at `$(npm bin)` or `$(npm bin -g)`.

### How to use

Global installation: This will allow you to use `tweego` as a shell command.

```sh
# Install
npm install --global tweego-bin
# Check that it worked.
tweego -v
```

Project-level installation: allows using Tweego inside scripts in package.json.
```sh
# Install
npm install --save-dev tweego-bin
# Check that it worked.
npm exec -c 'tweego -v'
```

See the [official Tweego docs](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/docs/) for using Tweego.

### Current limitations

* Builds are only available for x64 and x84 Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    * If you're on an ARM64 Mac, you'll either need to build Tweego from source, or try running this in `x86_64` mode.
* The executable on Windows will be named `tweego` instead of `tweego.exe`. Not sure if this actually works there yet.
